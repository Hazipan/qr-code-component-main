## My process

1.) Set up and format HTML in prep of styling
2.) Style from the outside, in.
  - Start with root to declare custom variables
  - Move on to the body for global styles
  - Style containers
  - Style conatiner content

### Built with

- CSS custom variables
- Flexbox
- Responsive design without media queries

### Continued development

I need to continue working on projects so that I can be comfortable with HTML and CSS to the point where I don't need to constantly be referencing notes.
